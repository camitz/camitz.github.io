<p>I know there is good rational behind putting off code optimizations, but I think we’ve been going overboard with that theme. So it was with relief that my boss told me now is the time to start profiling. Time to install <a href="http://www.miniprofiler.com">MiniProfiler</a>, in other words. Current version is 2.0.2.</p>

<p>I don’t know how people can live without it. It’s love and kittens for Asp.NET MVC developers, as <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NuGetPackageOfTheWeek9ASPNETMiniProfilerFromStackExchangeRocksYourWorld.aspx">Scott H</a> says.</p>

<p>I’ve been using it for some time on several projects but I haven’t installed the Entity Framework till now. That took a bit of head scratching as most of the stuff out there, including MiniProfiler docs, is about Code First setups. Some of my code is getting a bit antiquated, not least my Model First EF 4.2 usage. I just don’t know what the stuff on miniprofiler.com means.</p>

<p>##EF MiniProfiler for Model First projects</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6805478/168390">help</a> was available - as countless times before - signed Darin Dimitrov.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>var connectionString = ConfigurationManager
    .ConnectionStrings["MyConnectionString"]
    .ConnectionString;
var ecsb = new EntityConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString);
var sqlConn = new SqlConnection(ecsb.ProviderConnectionString);
var pConn = ProfiledDbConnection.Get(sqlConn, MiniProfiler.Current);
var context = ObjectContextUtils.CreateObjectContext&lt;CYEntities&gt;(pConn);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>##What about Unity Container?</p>

<p>I’m also using Unity Container to inject my object context so if I’m going to put the above anywhere, it’s in my container. Previously my container was configured like this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer()
	.RegisterType&lt;CYEntities&gt;(new PerHttpRequestLifetime(), new InjectionConstructor(connectionString));
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I need to use a customized piece of code to do the creating for me and I recall this is what is known as a factory. Unity supports this through InjectionFactory.</p>

<p>Hence</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer()
    .RegisterType&lt;CYEntities&gt;(GetLiftimeManager(lifeTimeManagerType), 
         new InjectionFactory(c=&gt; {
			var ecsb = new EntityConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString);                                                                                                                 var sqlConn = new SqlConnection(ecsb.ProviderConnectionString);                                                                                                                 var pConn = new EFProfiledDbConnection(sqlConn, MiniProfiler.Current);                                                                                                                 return pConn.CreateObjectContext&lt;CoinEntities&gt;(); 
		 }));
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And it works, too.</p>
